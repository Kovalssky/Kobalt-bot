Hi, I'm Kobalt!

A telegram bot for downloading video or audio from sources: TikTok, YouTube, Pinterest etc.

TODO: Make restrictions. Add support and add logging

## Language Support

Currently, the bot supports only **Russian** and **English** languages.

The bot uses automatic localization selection, meaning it adapts to the user's device language automatically by leveraging Telegram's built-in features.

Localization is implemented using the **Fluent** framework, providing flexible and convenient translation management.

New languages can be added by creating translation files inside the `locales` folder.

Examples of translation files can be copied and adapted from existing completed translations.

> The bot is currently in alpha version and will receive frequent updates.
